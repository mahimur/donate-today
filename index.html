                <p>Millions of people across Bangladesh, India and Nepal have been affected by floods caused by monsoon
                    rains. In Nepal, thousands of families have been forced to flee their homes to escape the floods
                    that
                    have claimed lives, destroyed homes and ruined food stocks. UNICEF is working with the government
                    and
                    partners to get help to those most in need.git </p>
