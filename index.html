            <p>Millions of people across Bangladesh, India and Nepal have been affected by floods caused by monsoon
                rains. In Nepal, thousands of families have been forced to flee their homes to escape the floods that
                have claimed lives, destroyed homes and ruined food stocks. UNICEF is working with the government and
                partners to get help to those most in need.git </p>
